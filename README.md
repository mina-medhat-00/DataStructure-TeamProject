# XML Editor with GUI Project

## Overview

This project is an XML editor with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the Unity game engine and implemented in C#. The editor is designed to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for working with XML files. In addition to standard XML editing capabilities, it offers several advanced features, including XML to JSON conversion, consistency checks for correct XML tags, XML file compression using the Huffman compression algorithm, and a graph data representation for visualizing the hierarchical structure of XML data.

## Key Features

### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The XML editor boasts an intuitive and interactive GUI, allowing users to open, create, save, and modify XML documents effortlessly. The interface is designed to accommodate both technical and non-technical users, making XML data management accessible to a wider audience.

### 2. XML to JSON Conversion

An essential feature of the editor is its ability to convert XML files to JSON format. This powerful conversion tool facilitates seamless data interchange between systems or applications that use either XML or JSON as their preferred data format. Users can easily switch between the two formats as needed.

### 3. Consistency Check

To ensure data integrity and accuracy, the editor includes a robust consistency check mechanism. This feature verifies the correctness of XML tags and structure, alerting users to any discrepancies or incorrect tag usage. By identifying errors early on, the editor helps maintain data consistency and avoids potential issues in downstream processes.

### 4. Huffman Compression

The editor addresses the challenge of large XML files by implementing the efficient Huffman compression algorithm. This compression technique reduces the file size while preserving the original XML data structure. As a result, users can optimize storage requirements and enhance data transfer efficiency.

### 5. Graph Data Representation

To provide users with a visual understanding of the hierarchical relationships within XML data, the editor includes a graph data representation feature. The graphical visualization offers an intuitive way to navigate complex XML documents and comprehend their underlying structure. This visualization can be particularly valuable for dealing with large and intricate XML datasets.

## Dependencies and Technologies

The XML Editor with GUI is built on the Unity game engine, utilizing its powerful UI components to create a seamless user experience. The editor's core functionality is implemented in C#, leveraging the language's versatility and performance.
